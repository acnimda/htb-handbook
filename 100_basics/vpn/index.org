Hack The Box uses a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to connect the users to the machines. To connect to this network we use a tool called ~openvpn~.

* Download the openvpn file.

1. Login to Hack The Box.
2. Click on the "Connect to HTB" button.
3. Select the server you want to connect to, then select ~OpenVPN~.
4. Download the OpenVPN file.

* Connect with OpenVPN

Open the file with ~openvpn~ within Kali:

#+begin_src shell
sudo openvpn ~/Downloads/<downloaded .ovpn file>
#+end_src

The command will display "Initilization Sequence Completed" when succesful.
