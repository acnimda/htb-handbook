* Copy contents of a file to the clipboard

The ~xclip~ command is very useful when you want to copy files to the clipboard.

#+begin_src
sudo apt install xclip
#+end_src

Use it as follows to put something on the internal clipboard of your VM:

#+begin_src
cat file | xclip -selection clipboard
#+end_src

If you want to use it to copy something from you VM to your host machine, use the ~primary~.

#+begin_src
cat file | xclip -selection primary
#+end_src
