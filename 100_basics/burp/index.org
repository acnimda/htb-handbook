#+title: ðŸ§ª Burp Proxy

To view and manipulate network traffic to and from websites we often use a tool called Burp Suite.

* Viewing traffic with the Proxy
To view traffic to and from websites Brup makes acts a so-called "proxy", acting as a middleman between the browser and webserver. The easiest way to connect through this proxy is by using Burp's built-in browser. To open this browser head to the ~Proxy~ tab, the ~Intercept~ tab and click on ~Open Browser~.

* Sending a modified request

If we want to modify a request we can do so by sending it to the ~Repeater~.

You can do so by right clicking on a request and selecting ~Send to Repeater~.
